# Proposal
## NutriTrack- Personalized Calorie and Nutrition Management
### Introduction

In a world where health and fitness are increasingly at the forefront of people’s minds, there is a growing need for tools to help individuals manage their dietary habits effectively. NutriTrack is a proposed Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to address this need by providing a user-friendly platform for tracking nutritional intake and managing diet goals.

NutriTrack is designed to simplify the complex and often tedious process of calorie and macro-nutrient tracking. Our target users range from those embarking on a fitness journey, individuals with specific dietary needs, to health enthusiasts who value a detailed understanding of their food intake. These users are in need of an accessible, easy-to-use tool that supports their nutritional goals.

### General Features

1. **Recipe Management:** NutriTrack allows users to input and store recipes, along with detailed macro-nutrient profiles. This feature caters to users who prefer homemade meals or have specific dietary requirements, allowing them to maintain a comprehensive record of their nutritional choices.
2. **Nutrient Tracking:** The core functionality revolves around tracking daily caloric and macro-nutrient intake against personalized goals. Users can set their nutritional targets based on factors like weight, fitness goals, and dietary preferences, providing a tailored and goal-oriented experience.
3. **Visual Progress Dashboard:** NutriTrack offers a dynamic and data-rich dashboard, enabling users to visualize their nutritional progress over time. Graphs and progress meters provide a quick snapshot, fostering a better understanding of their dietary habits and encouraging informed choices.
4. **Tailored Insights:** Users receive personalized insights generated by NutriTrack, offering guidance and recommendations to help them reach their nutritional targets. These insights may include meal suggestions, adjustments to goals, and tips for maintaining a balanced diet.

### Data

For NutriTrack to function, we will need to keep track of various user-specific data points. During account creation, users will provide a name, email, and password, information that will serve as the primary means of authentication. Users will set and manage their calorie and macro goals directly through the NutriTrack dashboard. We will also have to record and update the daily consumption data for each user, tracking their intake of calories and macronutrients. Each user will have a recipe list to pull meals from, updating their daily dashboard statistics.

NutriTrack will provide users with a prepopulated recipe list of common food items and meals. This database will be sourced through our research. The user’s recipe list will then be enhanced by their contributions. Users will engage with the platform by entering their custom recipes and providing a name and the details for the macros.

### PWA Capabilities

- Offline access to the application, enabling users to log meals and view nutritional data without an internet connection.
- Real-time synchronization and cross-platform compatibility for a consistent experience across various devices, ensuring that the user’s nutritional tracking remains seamless and up-to-date.
- Push notifications to prompt users to stay on track with their goals.
- A lightweight, no-installation-required app experience, with the responsiveness and feel of a native application.
- Media capture (mobile) and file uploads (desktop) to give users the ability to provide images with their recipes.
